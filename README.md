# ConSeal
Quickly take entire Volumes/Directores and convert them into a single
encrypted file. I think of this tool as a kind of black box packager 
for projects/data. Resulting files can be fairly large, depending on
the kind of data you throw in. Here's an example of using this tool 
to seal up an example directory tree.
